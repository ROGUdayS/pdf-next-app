# PDF Sharing Application

A modern, secure PDF sharing platform built with Next.js, Firebase, and TypeScript. This application allows users to upload, share, and manage PDF documents with granular permission controls.

## Features

### üîê Authentication & Security

- Firebase Authentication with email/password
- Secure OTP-based email verification
- Protected routes and API endpoints
- Granular access control system

### üìÑ PDF Management

- Upload and store PDFs securely in Firebase Storage
- Automatic thumbnail generation
- File size and type validation
- Real-time document management

### üîó Advanced Sharing System

- **Public Link Sharing**: Create shareable links for public access
- **Email-based Sharing**: Share with specific users via email
- **Per-user Permissions**: Individual save/download permissions
- **Access Management**: View and manage all users with access
- **Saved Copy Detection**: Track which users have saved copies

### üë• User Experience

- Responsive design with dark mode support
- Real-time updates using Firebase listeners
- Intuitive sharing interface with tabbed management
- Clear permission indicators and status messages
- Comprehensive access control feedback

## PDF Sharing Mechanism

### Sharing Methods

#### 1. Public Link Sharing

```typescript
// Enable public access via shareable link
{
  isPubliclyShared: true,
  allowSave: boolean // Global permission for public users
}
```

- Anyone with the link can access the PDF
- Global permission setting applies to all public users
- Can be enabled/disabled by the owner

#### 2. Email-based Sharing

```typescript
// Add specific users with individual permissions
accessUsers: [
  {
    email: "user@example.com",
    canSave: boolean, // Individual permission
    addedAt: Date,
  },
];
```

- Share with specific email addresses
- Individual permission control per user
- Email notifications sent to shared users

### Permission Levels

#### For Non-authenticated Users

- **Public PDFs**: View-only access, must login to save/download
- **Private PDFs**: No access (redirected to login)

#### For Authenticated Users

- **View Only** (`canSave: false`): Can view but cannot download, save, or open in new tab
- **Full Access** (`canSave: true`): Can view, download, save to collection, and open in new tab
- **Owner**: Full control including sharing, deleting, and permission management

### Access Control Logic

```typescript
// Access determination hierarchy
const hasAccess =
  isOwner || // PDF owner has full access
  hasExplicitAccess || // User in accessUsers array
  (isPubliclyShared && !requiresAuth); // Public access when enabled
```

### Saved Copies vs Shared Access

#### Shared PDF Access (`/shared/[id]`)

- Controlled by `accessUsers` array and `isPubliclyShared` flag
- Can be revoked by the owner
- Real-time access control

#### Saved Copies (User's Collection)

- Independent documents with `ownerId: user.uid`
- User has full ownership and control
- Cannot be revoked by original owner
- Appears in user's personal dashboard

### Share Dialog Interface

#### Share Tab

- **Default Permissions**: Set global permissions for new shares
- **Email Sharing**: Add users with individual permissions
- **Public Link Management**: Enable/disable public access
- **Permission Preview**: Shows what permissions will be applied

#### Manage Access Tab

- **User List**: View all users with access
- **Permission Toggles**: Change individual user permissions
- **Saved Copy Indicators**: Shows which users have saved copies
- **Access Revocation**: Remove user access with clear implications
- **Public Link Status**: Overview of public sharing settings

### Security Features

1. **Firebase Rules**: Server-side access control enforcement
2. **Real-time Validation**: Immediate access checks on page load
3. **Audit Trail**: Track when users are added/removed
4. **Clear Feedback**: Users understand their permission level
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Appropriate fallbacks for unauthorized access

### User Experience Flow

1. **Owner uploads PDF** ‚Üí Document created with owner permissions
2. **Owner shares PDF** ‚Üí Users added to accessUsers or public link enabled
3. **Users access PDF** ‚Üí Permission level determined and UI adapted
4. **Users save PDF** ‚Üí Independent copy created in user's collection
5. **Owner manages access** ‚Üí Real-time permission updates
6. **Access revoked** ‚Üí User loses shared access, retains saved copies

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Firebase Configuration

### Firestore Security Rules

The application uses comprehensive Firestore rules to ensure data security:

```javascript
// Allow read access to PDFs for authenticated and non-authenticated users
// Write access restricted to owners and authorized users
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /pdfs/{document} {
      allow read: if true; // Public read for sharing functionality
      allow write: if request.auth != null &&
        (request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId ||
         request.auth.token.email in resource.data.accessUsers);
    }
  }
}
```

### Storage Security Rules

Firebase Storage rules control file access:

```javascript
// Allow read access to PDF files and thumbnails
// Write access restricted to authenticated users
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /pdfs/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true; // Public read for sharing
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
