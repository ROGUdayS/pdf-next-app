# React 19 Upgrade and Netlify Deployment Fix

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to upgrade the PDF sharing application from React 18 to React 19 and fix Netlify deployment issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package.json Updates

- **React & React DOM**: Upgraded from `^18.2.0` to `^19.0.0`
- **TypeScript Types**: Updated `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to `^19.0.0`
- **Added Dependencies**:
  - `prebuild-install: ^7.1.2` (dev dependency for canvas compilation)
- **Overrides**: Added `react-is: ^19.0.0` to ensure compatibility

### 2. Node.js Version Update

- **Netlify**: Updated from Node.js 18 to Node.js 20 in `netlify.toml`
- **Local Development**: Added `.nvmrc` file specifying Node.js 20

### 3. Build Script Improvements

- **Primary Script** (`scripts/netlify-build.sh`):

  - Uses `npm install --force` to resolve React 19 peer dependency conflicts
  - Sets environment variables for canvas compilation
  - Updated for React 19 compatibility

- **Alternative Script** (`scripts/netlify-build-alternative.sh`):
  - Fallback script with multiple installation strategies
  - Handles canvas compilation failures gracefully
  - Can build without canvas if necessary (with reduced PDF functionality)

### 4. Netlify Configuration

- **Environment Variables**: Added canvas compilation settings
- **Node Version**: Specified Node.js 20 for better React 19 support
- **Build Command**: Uses the updated build script

## React 19 Compatibility Notes

### What's New in React 19

- **Performance Improvements**: Better rendering performance and memory usage
- **API Changes**: Some hooks have been updated (useFormState → useActionState)
- **Removed Features**: React.createFactory, defaultProps for function components

### Compatibility Check

✅ **No Breaking Changes Found**: The codebase doesn't use any deprecated React features:

- No `useFormState` usage (replaced by `useActionState` in React 19)
- No `React.createFactory` usage (removed in React 19)
- No `defaultProps` on function components (removed in React 19)

## Deployment Strategy

### Primary Approach

1. Use the main build script with `--force` flag
2. Node.js 20 environment
3. Canvas compilation with prebuild-install

### Fallback Approach

If the primary approach fails:

1. Switch to alternative build script in Netlify dashboard
2. Script will try multiple installation strategies
3. Can build without canvas if necessary

## Testing Recommendations

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test with Node.js 20
nvm use 20
npm install --force
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### Deployment Testing

1. Deploy with primary build script
2. If deployment fails, switch to alternative script
3. Monitor build logs for canvas compilation issues

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Canvas Compilation Failure

**Solution**: Alternative build script removes canvas and builds without it
**Impact**: PDF functionality may be limited but app will still work

### Issue 2: React 19 Peer Dependency Warnings

**Solution**: Using `--force` flag and overrides in package.json
**Impact**: Warnings are expected and safe to ignore

### Issue 3: TypeScript Compatibility

**Solution**: Updated TypeScript types to React 19 versions
**Impact**: Better type safety and IntelliSense

## Rollback Plan

If React 19 causes issues:

1. Revert package.json changes to React 18 versions
2. Remove overrides section
3. Update build script to use `--legacy-peer-deps`
4. Revert Node.js version to 18

## Next Steps

1. Deploy and test the application
2. Monitor for any React 19 specific issues
3. Update any third-party libraries that may need React 19 compatibility
4. Consider enabling React 19 strict mode features gradually
